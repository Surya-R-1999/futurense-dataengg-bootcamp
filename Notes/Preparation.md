# What is Big Data?

Big data refers to extremely large and complex data sets that traditional database management tools struggle to handle effectively. It consists vast amounts of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that require specialized tools and techniques for processing, storing, and analyzing.

# Why Big Data?
Big data is crucial for businesses as it enables **data-driven decision-making** by identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that provide valuable insights for strategic planning. It allows organizations to gain a competitive edge, improve customer engagement, and drive innovation through informed decision-making based on data analysis.

# Challenges in Big Data:
  - **Data Storage:** Managing the increasing volume of data is a significant challenge due to data doubling in size every two years.
  - **Data Quality:** Ensuring data accuracy and consistency is crucial but challenging with the vast amount of data collected.
  - **Scaling:** Adapting to the growing data volume and processing requirements poses scalability challenges.
  - **Security:** Protecting data from internal and external threats, especially personal and sensitive information, is a major concern.

# Big Data Use Cases:

  - Real-time processing
  - Batch processing
  - Machine learning applications
  - Predictive analytics etc...

# Limitations of Traditional BI Architecture: (3 V's - > Volume, Velocity, Variety)
Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) architectures face limitations in handling the **volume, variety, and velocity** of big data. They struggle with:
  - Processing and analyzing large and complex data sets efficiently.
  - Providing real-time insights due to data processing delays.
  - Scaling to meet the demands of growing data volumes.
  - Integrating diverse data sources effectively.
  - Ensuring data quality and consistency across different sources.
